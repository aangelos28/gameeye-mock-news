Metal Gear Solid has once again been delayed. This is not a new experience for CD Project Red. They have had numerous delays. There have been 3 delays total for one of the most anticipated games to be released. The director has stated that there have been difficulties in developments. Now, the game is delayed until 2021. 

The cause of the delay is a catastrophic glitch. There’s a quest that can be completed as one plays through the game normally. It’s possible to fulfill the requirements for the questline, but it won’t actually register as completed. Unfortunately, this questline is a requirement for many other questlines, including mandatory ones. So, CD Project Red have decided to take an increasingly rare path taken by developers and decided to delay the game release until the issues are fixed. 

One can never know when the bug will be fixed, but the estimate is early next year by the first quarter.
