miHoYo plans to add a new Dragonspine area. In addition, they plan to add updates once every 6 weeks. This means that gamers will stay striving to play the game for the foreseeable future just like Overwatch. Genshin Impact will stay relevant allowing simps to throw money at microtransactions for some waifus.
