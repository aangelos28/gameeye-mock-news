Metal Gear Solid has a radical new style. Everyone knows that Metal Gear Solid has adapted the style of cyberpunk into neo cyberpunk. What is neo cyberpunk? Itâ€™s a style of adding more colors to the otherwise bleak cyberpunk artstyle. After all, who cares about classics anymore? 

The colors will be new and invigorating. Metal Gear Solid will be all pink and green and yellow. What other better colors could there be? We all look forward to the new Metal Gear Solid
